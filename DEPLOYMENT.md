# Netlify Deployment Guide

## Overview
Your exam portal application is ready for deployment to Netlify as a static site. The app uses Firebase for backend services (authentication, database), so only the frontend needs to be deployed.

## Pre-deployment Setup

### 1. Build the Application
The application has been built successfully:
- Frontend assets are in `dist/public/` directory
- Build command: `npm run build` or `vite build`
- All dependencies are properly bundled

### 2. Configuration Files
- ✅ `netlify.toml` - Netlify configuration file
- ✅ Build output in `dist/public/` directory
- ✅ Firebase configuration integrated

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Deploy via Netlify Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Prepare your repository:**
   - Push all your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
   - Make sure `netlify.toml` is in the root directory

2. **Connect to Netlify:**
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Sign up or log in
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Choose your Git provider and select your repository

3. **Build Settings:**
   - Build command: `vite build` 
   - Publish directory: `dist/public`
   - Node version: 18
   - These settings are automatically configured via `netlify.toml`

   **Important:** If the build fails, manually set these in Netlify dashboard:
   - Build command: `vite build`
   - Publish directory: `dist/public`

4. **Deploy:**
   - Click "Deploy site"
   - Netlify will build and deploy your application
   - You'll get a URL like `https://your-app-name.netlify.app`

### Option 2: Manual Deploy

1. **Build locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy via Netlify Dashboard:**
   - Go to netlify.com and log in
   - Drag and drop the `dist/public` folder to the deploy area
   - Your site will be live immediately

## Firebase Configuration

Your Firebase configuration is already integrated with direct credentials:
- Authentication: ✅ Working
- Firestore Database: ✅ Working
- Analytics: ✅ Working

No additional environment variables needed since Firebase config is directly embedded.

## Post-deployment

### Domain Setup
- Netlify provides a free subdomain: `your-app-name.netlify.app`
- You can customize the subdomain in Netlify settings
- For custom domains, configure DNS in Netlify dashboard

### SSL Certificate
- Automatic HTTPS is enabled by Netlify
- Free SSL certificate included

### Performance Features
- Global CDN distribution
- Automatic asset optimization
- Form handling (if needed later)

## Monitoring and Updates

### Continuous Deployment
If using Git integration:
- Any push to your main branch automatically redeploys
- Build logs available in Netlify dashboard
- Rollback to previous versions available

### Analytics
- Netlify Analytics available (paid feature)
- Firebase Analytics already integrated in your app

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Build fails:** Check Node version (should be 18+)
2. **404 errors:** Ensure `netlify.toml` has correct redirects
3. **Firebase errors:** Verify Firebase configuration
